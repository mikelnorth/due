# Due

Due is a group project created by @tbates93, @keithdidier, @mikelnorth and @AlexElls21.

## Function

Due lets calendars be shared between students at a university, while retaining the ability to mark items as complete individually.

## Technology used

Due uses React and Redux on the front end, with Node.js, Express, Massive, and PostgreSQL on the back end.
